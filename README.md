# socia.dot  
socia.dot is a minimalistic open frontend, social network clone (like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter) completely developed with Godot in GDScript, built on top of our GodotFirebase addon as a backend interface for Firebase. This is just a Demo to give a general overview about all the features provided by GodotFirebase (Authentication, Firestore, Realtime Database, Storage).
